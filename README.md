# Random CNPJ Generator

This is a Python script that generates random CNPJs (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jur√≠dica) with valid verification digits.

## How it works

The script uses the `random` module to generate 12 random digits, which represent the CNPJ base number. Then, it calculates the two verification digits required for a valid CNPJ. Finally, the script formats the CNPJ with dots, slashes, and hyphens in the standard CNPJ format.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```
```
python main.py
```
The script will generate 5 random CNPJs and print them to the console.

## Example Output
```
Generated CNPJs: ['12345678000123', '87654321000109', '98765432000101', '45678901200195', '78901234500104']
```
## Disclaimer
Please note that the CNPJs generated by this script are randomly generated and may not correspond to real entities. This script is intended for educational and testing purposes only.
